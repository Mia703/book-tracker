Not for herself, not for her readers, and not even for her characters, for whom she secretly writes alternate endings that swap weddings and babies for divorce papers and the occasional slashed tire. When her Happily Never After document is hacked and released to the public, she finds herself canceled by her readers and dropped by her publisher.

Desperate to find a way to continue supporting her chronically ill sister, Savannah, Margot decides to trade meet-cutes for murder. The fictional kind. Probably. But when Savannah books Margot a six-week stay in a remote Alaskan resort to pen her first murder mystery, Margot finds herself running from a moose and leaping into the arms of the handsome proprietor, making her fear she’s just landed in a romance novel instead.

The last thing Dr. Forrest Wakefield ever expected was to leave his dream job as a cancer researcher to become a glorified bellhop. What he’s really doing at his family’s resort is caring for his stubborn, ailing father, and his puzzle-loving mind is slowly freezing over—until Margot shows up. But Forrest doesn’t have any room in his life for another person he could lose, especially one with a checkout date.

If helping a sarcastic brunette make another guy jealous will help him secure his position on the team, he’s all for it.

I was sooo shook,"What’s better than attending your ex’s wedding? A camping trip in the woods, complete with bugs, critters, and sharing a tent with the hottest—and most infuriating—man alive. It’s basically a full itinerary of terrible decisions…
George:
When I came home for the first time in years, I was expecting a peaceful week celebrating my ex’s upcoming nuptials, some quality time with my overly enthusiastic mom, and a much-needed break from the dumpster fire that my life has become. Instead, I’ve been tricked into sharing a tent with Alex—the human equivalent of a smug smirk—who somehow manages to be both infuriating and alarmingly attractive. He pushes every button I have, knows exactly how to get under my skin, and worst of all… I think I want him to. Which is great, because nothing says “relaxing vacation” like emotional whiplash and unresolved sexual tension in a nylon sweatbox.

Alex:
I keep things casual. It’s easier that way. Safer than letting someone in and finding out—once again—that I’m not enough, or worse, that I’m too much. But George? He’s messing with my game plan. He’s uptight, prickly, and has made it painfully clear that he doesn’t like me. But there’s something in the way his eyes spark when we argue, something in his laugh and those quiet moments when we’re not at each other’s throats, that draws me in. The more time we spend together, the harder it is to ignore the pull between us. It terrifies me—because I want him, badly—but I can’t let him see the mess I’ve been hiding behind these walls. Not now. Not ever.

Finn needs a local to help him complete his London bucket list, and Ava needs to reassure Josie she won’t be on her own. And it’s only for a few months.

To Ava’s surprise, their mismatched friendship of convenience becomes oddly tolerable, and as they work their way through Finn’s list and around the sun-drenched city, from rooftops and floating bars to nights at the museum, their adventures—and Finn’s company—start to feel . . . nice.

As the PT for the Bringham Bobcats, he knows they're loud, cocky, and more trouble than they’re worth. Not to mention painful reminders of the career ripped from his grasp a decade ago—a past he’s desperate to leave behind. All he needs to do is finish his business course and open his own practice to be free of hockey forever. It’s all going according to plan, until a dirty-mouthed young hotshot who won't take no for an answer waltzes into his office, and Jamie’s forced to reconsider whether he’s ready to give up on the game.

They call him a rising star, so why does Archie Bowman still feel like a rookie? Maybe it’s the number of times he’s been traded in his short career. Maybe it’s the homesickness for the family, biscuits, and rugby he left behind in Britain. Or maybe it’s how, despite everyone else buying his cocky act, he still isn’t sure he belongs in the big leagues.

I’m the spare, the younger brother of the Prince of Wales. Ever since I was propelled up the order of succession, my job description has been: Exist. Don’t embarrass the Crown. Repeat.

After a security scandal, I’m assigned a new bodyguard. A hulking, brooding Irishman who glowers at me like I’ve personally offended his ancestors. He’s the first to be completely immune to my charm, which is rather inconvenient when you’ve always wielded wit like a defensive weapon.

And why I feel the need to continue trying to impress Officer O’Connell is anyone’s guess.

My upcoming royal tour of Australia and New Zealand should be a nice chance to escape the British winter and bask in some Southern Hemisphere sunshine. But it turns out that representing the monarchy in former colonial countries means confronting some uncomfortable truths about how all those Crown Jewels ended up in my family’s vaults.

Each of the boyfriends is pretty interesting, and honestly, I feel like I’d need to make a whole mood board just to capture each of their personalities.

Final Thoughts:
This was a pretty good read, even if it felt like it took forever to finish. To be fair, that’s mostly my fault — I accidentally bought the entire series at once, so every time I thought I was done with a book, I was actually just starting the next one.

As for the story itself, I found it really engaging! Each of the guys Sorsha falls in love with is completely different, but together they balance each other out perfectly. Their dynamic as they go on their crusade to destroy the Company of Light was one of my favorite parts — you get these really nice glimpses into each of their minds, and you can see how Sorsha complements their weaknesses.

That said, the only characters that really bothered me were Sorsha herself and Tempest. Since Sorsha is the main character, most of the story is told from her POV — which is fine — but sometimes it felt like she was talking just to talk. Some of her inner monologue didn’t really add much to what was happening in the moment. I also wasn’t a fan of how often she got angry over every little thing, though it does make sense in context since it ties into her struggles with controlling her powers.

What I didn’t totally buy was her ongoing anger toward humanity and the Shadow Defense Fund. She’s frustrated that everyday humans won’t go out of their way — risking their homes, jobs, or even jail time for murder — to help Shadowkind. And like… girl, I get it, but let’s be real. Not everyone’s going to throw away their life for a war they barely understand. I’m not saying her anger doesn’t make sense (the Company of Light is committing attempted genocide, after all), but her expectations of humanity were kind of unrealistic. Later in the book she does start to acknowledge the human mindset a bit more, which helped balance that out.

My other big issue was Tempest’s motivation. The only reason she created a disease to wipe out Shadowkind was because it was fun? Really? That didn’t sit right with me. After centuries of manipulating humans into believing they were working toward some grand goal, “because it was fun” feels like a weak explanation. There were so many other, more compelling reasons the author could’ve chosen — power, vengeance, corruption — anything! But “fun” just didn’t do it for me.

Overall though, this book was a great read. The relationships were interesting, the world-building was solid, and even though a few things didn’t land perfectly for me, it was definitely worth the time.","I make a living out of screwing over the jerks who capture and torment supernatural beasties. But when I free a bunch of particularly powerful monsters from their cages, I'm not counting on them following me home like lost puppies.

Stunningly hot lost puppies, but still.

And when I find out they're up against the same creeps who murdered the person I love most, I'm all for joining forces. There's something to be said for allies so devoted they'll tear off heads and shred souls on your behalf.

1. Leave Ireland in the dead of night to flee to London;
2. Get yourself dragged into an alley by a demon, marked, and doomed to die;
3. Gain a mysterious, fatally attractive stalker/saviour. One with strangely sharp teeth…

Flynn

I never asked for this.

Okay, maybe a little. After all, the demon was undeniably hot–the perfect way to mend my broken heart.

But I certainly didn’t sign up to become his prey–because now my chest burns with ice as dark magic grows inside me… and he’ll be back to collect it.

But if he keeps looking at me like I'm something worth devouring, I might just let him.

Sebastián

Five centuries has taught me three rules: stay detached, stay focused, and never, never feel too much.

Except, apparently, we do now.

When my protective instincts quickly twist into feelings, I know I should walk away.

For how long can I keep my true vampiric nature from him?

In the meantime, at least watching him try to figure out why everyone keeps making bat jokes in front of me is… admittedly entertaining.

I think the other books will be interesting too ","A witch without power. A werewolf with everything to lose. A forbidden love that will change it all.

Atlas:
Being a werewolf and the star of the wrestling team means my life is all about control—control on the mat, control under the full moon, and control over my emotions. I’ve spent years perfecting it. But then I met Caden, and all that control started to slip. He’s a witch without magic—or so everyone says—but there’s something about him that draws me in. He’s got this quiet intensity, a spark that feels more powerful than any spell I’ve ever seen.

But in a place like Widdershins Academy, where bloodlines and magical purism rule, witches and werewolves are not supposed to mix. The rules are clear, and breaking them could cost me everything—my pack, my title, and even my future. Yet, every time Caden looks at me, every time he brushes against me, it feels like the world shifts, and suddenly, those rules don’t seem so unbreakable. I can feel his soul calling to mine and when I finally get up the nerve to kiss him, I know I won’t be able to stop.

Caden:
I’ve spent my whole life feeling like a failure. Born into a legacy of pureblood witches, I should have been powerful, but my magic never came. In a world where worth is measured by power, I’ve always been on the outside, trying to blend in and failing miserably. And then there’s Atlas.

He’s everything I’m not—strong, confident, and untouchable. But somehow, he sees me, really sees me, in a way no one else ever has. When he’s near, it’s like I’m more than just a powerless witch. But I know better than to hope. He’s a werewolf, an alpha, and everything about our world is designed to keep us apart.

When a cruel prank leaves me stranded in the woods during a deadly snowstorm, it’s Atlas who finds me. He saves my life, his wolf instincts guiding him through the snow, but the storm traps us together in an abandoned cabin. There’s no escaping the truths we’ve been avoiding, and as the fire crackles, we give into the instincts we’ve been denying for too long. In those intimate moments, I see the vulnerability he tries to hide, and for the first time, I believe I might be someone he truly needs.

But the storm is only the beginning. When a magical attack threatens Widdershins Academy, we’re thrust into a battle bigger than either of us. As purists tighten their grip on our world, we’re faced with an impossible choice: defy the rules that divide us and risk everything for the love we’ve found or let the system win and tear us apart before we’ve even had a chance.

Hexmate is a heart-pounding, magical sweet and spicy romance filled with forbidden love, sizzling chemistry, and the courage to challenge a world built on division. Set against the enchanting backdrop of Widdershins Academy, Caden and Atlas’s story is a spellbinding tale of resilience, redemption, and the power of love to rewrite destiny.",2025-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,false,,9798313461502,ISBN_13,274,,,great,eBook,finished,2025-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,A Gay Shifter Paranormal Academy Romance (Widdershins Supernatural Academy Book 1),Hexmate,bookworm7572@gmail.com,2025-09-02T18:20:20.707Z,rec_d2rjap4la0oerlmjf1sg,2025-09-11T18:52:15.158Z,6

The humans and the supernaturals mostly keep to their own kind, but Luca—curious and desperate for work—crosses the border and finds himself employed by a tall, stupidly handsome Fae with killer horns.

Cair Haryk is only a visitor to the human world and, between his position in the Fae kingdom and a bargain he made years ago, he can never remain. He's content with that until he meets Luca—his soulmate—and hires him to work in his high-end lounge. Cair tries to guard his heart, but fate has other plans and, despite his best intentions, he falls for the pretty little human. Hard.

Luca can't enter the Fae realm, and Cair’s time in the mortal lands is drawing to an end, so while the attraction between them is irresistible, their situation is impossible. They can't be together. It’s tragedy and heartbreak just waiting to happen.

Leovander Loveage is a master of small magics. He can summon butterflies with a song or turn someone’s hair pink by snapping his fingers. Though such minor charms don’t earn him much respect, anything more elaborate always blows up in his face, and so Leo vowed long ago never to use powerful magic again.

Grimm is Leo’s complete opposite—respected, exceptionally talented, and absolutely insufferable.

Overall, this was a whirlwind in the best kind of way. I still don’t quite see how the main lead, Rav Trivedi, is Indian since he wasn’t described in much detail — but hey, yay for representation!

The murder mystery was exciting, fast-paced, and full of tension. I was constantly on edge whenever Detective Rav Trivedi was at risk of losing his job because he was trying to juggle his career and his forbidden romance. His lover, Jack Vale, was such a layered character — an onion full of surprises. You’d expect a grunge-rock frontman to be arrogant or harsh, but Jack was the complete opposite: anxious, quiet, and deeply passionate about his music. I loved watching Rav swoop in to help him battle both his inner and outer demons.

And when the truth came out? I was shocked. I knew it had to be someone in the band’s inner circle, but the way the author revealed everything was brilliant. It all tied together perfectly at the end.

This book was full of action, tension, and heart — I loved every second of it!","Brooklyn 99 meets The Charm Offensive in this sparkling romantic murder mystery: it's murder cute in the first degree when a detective finds himself falling for the lead suspect in a career-making case.

At 29, Detective Rav Trivedi is the youngest member of the NYPD’s homicide squad, and his future looks bright. He may be a bit of an outsider in the department—an ivy-league educated gay Brit with a weakness for designer suits—but his meteoric rise and solve rate prove he belongs.

So when his CO assigns him lead on the high-profile murder of a record executive, Rav is ready for action. He won’t be distracted by TV crews, tabloids, or what’s trending on social media, nor by the ridiculously hot rock star with a clear motive and no alibi.

Awwww, this was cute! Little Red and his Wolf finally got their HEA. This story was such a sweet reminder that sometimes you find someone who loves you even more than you love yourself. sobs

Red was everything you’d expect — charming, endearing, and a little annoying at times. Growing up in the Queen’s court, he was taught to keep his head down and make himself invisible. Years of being told by royalty and nobles that he was strange, ugly, unwanted, and unloved left deep scars — ones he started to believe. That is, until he meets Wilhelm (or “Wim” for short).

Wim sees Red for who he truly is: talented, amazing, and deserving of love. Throughout the story, Wim fights to quiet Red’s inner demons again and again, and I adored that dynamic. Their relationship was tender and supportive, and it made me root for them from the start.

I loved the twist at the end — finding out the Wicked Witch is actually Red’s long-lost mother, and that the curse turning Wim into a blood-crazed monster was caused by Red’s own father. All that tragedy stemmed from the Queen’s selfishness and the bitterness rooted in her and the Witch’s childhood past. I loved that hint that there’s still more to uncover in future stories — it adds great depth to the worldbuilding.

The tone was dark, grim, and very Grimm, which I appreciated. But one thing I didn’t love was how the author portrayed Red as constantly helpless. The story establishes that he’s a skilled archer, yet we rarely see him act independently or take charge. Almost every time he’s in danger, Wim ends up swooping in to save him, which made Red feel more passive than he should’ve been. I wanted to see him do more, because it’s clear he could if given the chance.

Still, despite that flaw, I really enjoyed the book. It was fun, cute, spicy in all the right places, and left me excited to read the other Grimm fairytale retellings in the series.","Abandoned as a babe and raised in The Queen's court, Red has always been an outsider, with his mismatched eyes and sharp tongue keeping most at arm's length. When he ventures towards the Dark Forest on an important quest to save his kingdom from the grips of a cruel famine, the last thing he needs is a massive grey wolf stalking him. A wolf who makes it clear that Red looks like a very tasty snack.

Wilhelm ‘Wim’ Hoffmann is dangerous, infuriating, and absolutely not to be trusted—no matter how his deep voice makes Red’s traitorous heart stutter. If only Wim wasn't devastatingly handsome, if only he didn’t cook up such sumptuous meals and use his superior body heat to keep Red warm at night… Then Red might remember that wolves aren't supposed to be trusted, especially ones with secrets as dark as the forest itself.

But Red knows better than to fall for a wild creature's charms... Right?

Surviving these treacherous woods—where slave traders and bandits lurk around every corner—will require more than just an uneasy alliance. As their bond deepens with each shared danger, Red begins to wonder if being devoured by a big bad wolf might not be so bad after all...


This GriMM Tales retelling features one red-cloaked menace and the wolf that sees through his armour, touch him and get eaten alive, a smidge of an age gap, a dash of primal play, a wolf who wants strokes, two bedrolls but let’s share one for warmth & a HEA.

This book was bad — and far too long for the plot it offered. Centered on the supposed love between Sebastian, a kitsune, and his werewolf mate Liam, I expected a fun, engaging paranormal romance between two shifters. Instead, I got a dragged-out story packed with endless internal monologues, a main character who refuses to stop running, and a romance that felt forced from the author’s hand rather than natural growth between the characters.

Let’s start with Sebastian. I understand that his trauma is serious — the story discusses SA with Seb's past physically and emotinally abusive lover, and I can empathize with why he feels the need to run from his past, his adoptive father, and the pack. But at some point, enough is enough. You can only run so far before you’re cornered, and it was emotionally exhausting watching him run instead of ever facing things head-on. What made it worse is that it was clear, through both actions and Liam’s repeated reminders, that his father genuinely loved him; even at least in his own way. Even if he never said the words, his actions showed it time and time again. It was incredibly frustrating that Seb couldn’t see that or at least try to communicate. His fear and avoidance became less sympathetic and more infuriating by the end.

And don’t even get me started on the mating process. I didn’t like it at all. It felt forced — as if the author couldn’t figure out how to bring them together naturally, so she just let Seb’s fox instincts take over and complete the bond. Sure, Seb says he’s okay with it, but it didn’t feel earned. It read more like something the author made happen rather than something the characters chose.

Then there’s Nicky — a completely brushed-aside subplot. The child’s kidnapping should have been a major emotional turning point, but Seb barely seems to care, and the story moves on too quickly. Later, you realize it’s setup for another spin-off, but honestly, that just makes it worse. It feels like the author sacrificed an important emotional thread for the sake of marketing another book.

On top of all that, the book was way too long. The author could have reached the emotional climax — Seb realizing he’s enough and accepting his bond with Liam — hundreds of pages earlier. Instead, we get repetitive tangents of Seb’s overthinking and worldbuilding that doesn’t serve the plot. At one point, there are five to ten pages about ghouls and their history before the story finally circles back to a crime scene full of dead bodies. The pacing was just all over the place.

Some descriptions were so vague I could barely visualize the creatures or settings, yet the book spent excessive detail on unimportant side notes. It was frustrating.

Overall, this was a meh read for me — a long, disappointed sigh. The author wasted pages on unnecessary detail, forced emotional moments that didn’t land, and skipped over things that actually mattered. I closed the book feeling drained, not satisfied.","Sebastian has always been the outsider, a fox raised among wolves. He's survived on his wit, magic, and instincts, but he's always on the run. That is until he meets Liam, the alpha werewolf, who’s commanding and powerful presence Sebastian cannot resist.

There’s magic between them, a spark of something beyond a fox or a wolf; an awakening energy only fate could create. But their happiness is short-lived when Sebastian's dark past comes back to haunt him, unleashing a threat they cannot ignore.

Together they face rogue wolves, fae monsters and even demons who threaten their newfound bond. Can they unite their different worlds and fight this evil force, or will their love be torn apart by the darkness that seeks to destroy them?

Ramin was absolutely adorable, and the chemistry between the two was so fun to read (especially when they started to really explore each other—wink, wink!).

THIS WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD! I mostly read it cause the cover was CRAZY. I was like gurl, you're really tring to make sure everyone knows what kind of books I be reading. *side eye*. I also thought it be a meh book at first, but it was honestly well written! Flynn is an omega, who because of a surrogacy for friend, can't stop producing milk. This affects his personal relationships and his work, making him feel like he has to apologise for always leaking and needing to express his milk. Then enters Seth, a man with a *cough cough* lactation fetish?! He sees Flynn as everything he's ever wanted and goes out of his way to make sure a relationship is formed. Honestly, I feel like the first half of the book was unnecessary but then that would have made the amazing content warning tags at the beginning of the book moot.  I wouldn't say Seth ""tricks"", but that's the best word that fits the bill, Flynn into signing a contract where HE THINK'S  he's expressing milk for a family in need. IN ACTUALITY, Seth went through legal means mind you, to contract Flynn to express milk specifically FOR HIM. The contract thing doesn't bother me, because again, he went through legal means to contract Flynn, but what does bother me is the things he does afterwards. He places Flynn in practically a showroom, where Seth can watch Flynn without his knowledge. Which is WRONG. On top of that, he lightly DRUGS, Flynn with sleeping pills so he'll stay longer, which is ALSO WRONG. Then ""in a moment of weakness"", touches Flynn in his sleep, which is TRIPLE WRONG. On top of Seth lightly STALKING HIM. Of course, everything Seth did to Flynn comes out in the light and Flynn is of course rightfully mad... but he's mad for the wrong reasons! He's more focused on the fact that his milk wasn't helping a family and then follows up with ""hey, you did these things without my consent"" as an after thought.  So the next half of the book is Flynn putting Seth through h*ll and back to make sure Seth realises he was wrong. And Seth is willing to do anything to get his man back. Obviously, Flynn takes Seth back, saying he actually LIKED what Seth did to him, he just didn't like the fact he did it without consent. Then they're back together doing all the crazy *cough cough* erotic things Flynn always wanted to do but never had someone to do it with (of course with consent this time). And they live happily ever after with Seth and Flynn living together and having three kids. Honestly, it wasn't a bad book, not my style, but not a bad book. It was well written with dynamic characters and the love was there, even if weird. Could the author have taken a very obvious and different route with these two to still to the crazy things they wanted to do but with consent, yes, but you can't say she didn't live up to the content warnings presented in the book. She said what she said *side eye*. The only niggling thing for me was that Seth never explicitly marked Flynn or even put a ring on him for that matter, but it was heavily implied. I also didn't see anywhere in this book, even later, Seth discussing with Flynn safe words. It says that Seth was able to figure out if Flynn was done for real or not, but I think the discussion of safe words later in the book would have really topped the cake for me. Again, it wasn't a bad book. The author listed the content warnings with total honesty and met the content warnings in the book. Can't be mad since I knew what I was walking into, just not how it would be presented.

Oh, also note this was read on Apple Books, mostly cause everyone can see what I buy on Kindle. I was able to find the book for free online thanks to eBook Hunter, but one day I hope to move it to my Kindle.

And when Kieran takes him in the heat of the sauna, Ty expects it to end like every other hookup: fast, filthy, and forgettable.

But Kieran breaks the rules. He stays. He shares his name. And when they take a dip in the pool after, it’s not just lust in Kieran’s voice—it’s something deeper. Protective. Possessive. Maybe even… tender?

What starts as a primal encounter spirals into heated glances, unexpected tenderness, and a promise of more.

---

Honestly, this was a really good book! I was so emotionally invested in the characters that I wanted to scream at times. Dayton and Rowland are both emotionally scarred thirty-somethings with deeply traumatic pasts. Dayton, an omega with an unusual scent, has been repeatedly abandoned by lovers who couldn’t handle it. Rowland, an extreme alpha, worries that his intense pheromones could overwhelm others. On top of that, he’s dealing with a painful divorce from an ex-wife who became increasingly prejudiced against secondary genders. Throughout the divorce process, she blamed everything on Rowland’s secondary gender and later fed this same hatred and bigotry to their young daughter, Mina.

Rowland and his ex share three children: Shawn, the oldest in college; Mina, the teenage middle child; and Mac, the youngest at about six years old. Rowland has internalized the hostility he endured from his ex-wife, while Dayton has internalized the rejection he’s faced from others. Both men are quietly battling their own self-loathing. What makes this story so beautiful is how it becomes a love story about giving love a second, third, fourth, and finally fifth chance.

I was *so* angry with Mina. She absorbed all of her mother’s hatred and went out of her way to sabotage any chance of Rowland and Dayton being together—interrupting their date, calling Dayton a “garden tool,” and even hitting herself and blaming Dayton. Rowland, being a good and attentive father, can’t help but take her side, even though he knows deep down Dayton would never hurt her. I was furious during those scenes. There were moments when I wanted to yell at Rowland, “If you don’t step up and parent her, I will!” Someone needed to tell that little girl that her behavior was completely unacceptable.

Thankfully, things are resolved once we learn that Mina herself is an omega and is terrified of presenting—terrified of how her mother would react, terrified of what it meant for her self-image, and overwhelmed by the twisted beliefs she’d been taught to internalize.

The only thing I’m still longing for is closure about whether Dayton and Rowland might have a child together. The book mentions that Dayton is a bit older biologically for pregnancy, and they decide to “see what happens,” but I would’ve loved an epilogue clarifying whether they did have a child or whether Dayton felt content being a parent to the children already in their lives.

Overall, it was a genuinely cute book. Honestly, it’s funny that an omegaverse story gave me the most realistic courtship and HEA I’ve read in months. Dayton and Rowland both had relatable insecurities and believable challenges, and they supported each other beautifully. Both were compelling, incredibly likeable characters.","Dayton is in a place in his life where he's just about to give up on finding a suitable partner to start a family with. As a male omega over thirty, his biological clock is ticking louder and louder. If it weren't for his mothers, he probably would have given up on dating already. He's one of the few unlucky individuals whose pheromones smell nothing like the sweet, lovely scent they should. Following a string of unsuccessful relationships, he starts to believe that he might have to settle with either being alone or ending up with a beta, even to the dismay of his well-meaning parents.

Rowland's circumstances are a little complicated. No matter his successful career and good looks, there's no sugarcoating the fact that he's a thirty-eight-year-old divorcee with three children, at least one of which is becoming more and more of a handful by the day. Never having recovered from his wife's cruel departure, he's far too aware that his pheromone condition would be too much to handle for most people. When his mother sets him up on yet another blind date, he relents. Under the condition of it being the last.

I literally cried while reading it — not just because it was emotional, but because of how raw, honest, and human it felt.

This novel touches on so many heavy themes: loss, grief, addiction, anxiety, mental health, military trauma, self-love, and the power of found family. What struck me most was how real and unflinching the book was about these struggles, while still showing that healing and forgiveness are possible.

Will Cowen is such an emotional and compelling character. His anxiety is portrayed so vividly that I felt swept up in his waves of emotion, but beneath it all is a huge, generous heart. He’s a bright light, strong even when he doubts himself, and watching him fall in love with Graham was breathtaking. I loved how he communicates honestly, takes responsibility, and allows himself to feel deeply without pushing love away.

Graham turned out to be more layered than I expected. I thought he would be the stoic, always-strong partner, but he’s complex, emotionally clear, and simply wants to love and be loved. I appreciated how he separates himself from Will’s struggles and processes his own feelings with clarity. Their relationship avoids the typical miscommunication tropes I see so often in romance, which kept me feeling fully invested and tense in a good way throughout the book.

I also loved that there was intimacy in the story — some heat, but never too much. As someone who reads a lot of MM romance, I appreciated that it fit perfectly with the emotional context. It wasn’t overwhelming or too mild; it just deepened the connection naturally.

I adored seeing supportive parents on both sides of the couple. It felt so affirming to have characters fully supported by family while being out as gay men. The realism in the struggles of both Will and Graham also stood out — Graham dealing with a chaotic alcoholic brother, Will supporting him while carrying his own trauma. I found the glimpses into Will’s past, including his biological father and Laura’s connection to him, fascinating, and I wish there had been more depth there. I would have loved to explore Graham’s family history more as well, and seeing the wedding would’ve been the perfect conclusion.

One thing I kept wishing for was to get into Graham’s head more — to see all the thoughts and feelings he has about Will. I think it would have added an even deeper layer to the story.

Overall, this book felt like art in its emotional depth. Every moment, every description of love, every layer of pain or joy was written so beautifully. Even after finishing, I’m thinking about Will and Graham and how their love and struggles felt so real.

Reading this made me excited to revisit Riley Hart’s other works, especially knowing that Winning It With You is by the same author and that Dearly Departed is coming next. This book really stayed with me, and I loved reflecting on every piece of it.","Not to jinx it or anything, but the stars seem to finally be aligning for Will Cowen. After accepting a dream promotion at one of New York City’s most renowned publishing houses and moving in with his oldest friend, he’s ready to dive headfirst into this new chapter and take the literary world by storm – that is, until he crosses paths with Graham Austin.

No matter how hard he tries, he can’t help but put the wrong foot forward in front of the all-business and inconveniently gorgeous heir to the publishing empire.

So, when a heartbreakingly beautiful manuscript lands on his desk, Will seizes the opportunity for a win. Could this prized new author be his big break or, his downfall?

Will’s confidence and hope for his professional future is obliterated when the author ghosts him at an important publishing event. Fueled by insecurity and an open bar, he finds himself in need of comfort, which comes from the least likely person, the normally cold and distant Graham. This small glimpse behind Graham’s icy exterior is the spark that sweeps these two up in an epic and unforeseen romance.

As his author’s manuscript begins to take shape, the words that initially brought them together become more and more tangled, making it painfully obvious to Will that despite your best efforts, there is truly no hiding from the past.
